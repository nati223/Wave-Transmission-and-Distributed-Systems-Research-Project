# Wave-Transmission-and-Distributed-Systems-Research-Project
Here we present you a research project given in 3rd year course wave transmission and distributed systems in the faculty of electrical engineering in
Tel Aviv University.
In this project we will formulate a numeric algorithm that will help us explore and match wave transmittance over a non-homogenous transmission line,
a problem that can't be solved analytically.

In this repository you will find:
1. Research project instructions.
2. Our research document, and conclusions.
3. Two python files, the second one handles question 2 sections c and d, as they were part of a competition of achieving the widest
bandwidth possible where the line is matched.
